### Rules

- **Inbox rule**: If unsure where a note belongs, use `capture` — it routes to the inbox for nightly processing. Do NOT guess a vault folder.
- **Paths**: Vault folders use numbered prefixes: `01_identity/`, `02_journal/`, `03_projects/`, `04_areas/`, `08_decisions/`, `09_meetings/`, `00_inbox/`, etc.
- **Today's daily note path**: `02_journal/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Weekly note path**: `02_journal/weekly/YYYY-Www.md`
- **Decisions**: Open decisions live in `08_decisions/open/`; decision log at `08_decisions/decision_log.md`
- **Meetings**: All meeting notes go to `09_meetings/`

### Sample Commands

- "Brief me" → `get_brief`
